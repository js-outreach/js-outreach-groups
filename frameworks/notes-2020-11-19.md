## Agenda & Notes
* November 2020 TC39 agenda
   * DE: Some interesting topics where we shored up alignment between spec and various implementations
      * Extensions and :: operator (pipeline/bind) - mixed reviews, not sure if it made it to stage 1 in the end
      * Idea to add .item() to Array.prototype not web compatible
      * RegExp match indices need an API change (idea is to get beginning and end index of each match) But has performance overhead so can't have it always on
      * JSON modules should go to stage 3 next meeting
      * Realm API - create a new global object, heard concerns from browsers about how this would fit into the web in a broader sense; current web proposal has only JS globals but no web globals - thoughts?
      * JH: web folks continue to insist that there's no difference between web+language globals and folks don't know; but most people do know and there's cases where folks want one or the other kind of realm; but this isn't something that most users will use (like SIMD or atomics), so maybe it's not a big deal.
      * DE: agree, there's more variability between JS host environments, wondering if others have feedback
      * MH: Been doing lots of e2e testing w/ puppeteer and ?? - code want to run in both browser and node, this is more of an advanced thing, don't expect everyone to use it, but for tooling this would make worker adoption easier [to include web globals?]
      * DE: Should the realm contain setTimeout or need to be added manually?
      * MH: On surface it seems useful to have it, but need to think more about it; sandbox nature suggests…?
      * DE: discussion is on proposal-realms/issues/284
      * JDD: Make it configurable? Then bikeshedding on defaults is secondary
      * JH: subclasses with presets: web realm, node realm, etc - seems like the right default since in majority case you don't need to customize anything, but can customize if needed; forcing folks to add everything manually for common cases is pretty bad experience; any comments on full configurability but packaging up platform defaults?
      * RB: shimming another environment's realms would be pretty useful
      * DE: browser counterargument is that in conceptual model, folks shouldn't be thinking about separation between language and web APIs, so there shouldn't be a "non-web" realm.  could have only web realms (outside TC39) but that would be unfortunate.
      * JH: never really understood that insistence - would be nice if web was a unified thing, but (e.g.) SO discussions suggest that everyone knows there's a real separation
      * DE: please comment on the issue
   * Temporal should be ready for stage 3 (slides)
      * Now is time for finalizing API based on feedback so far, really want review
   * Error cause -> stage 2, allows chaining errors
   * JS Module Blocks -> stage 1, seemed well received by lots of parties
      * Module block is very different from a closure since it doesn't close over anything, more like an "abstract code snippet" - early parsing (w/ eager errors) but no other closure semantics
   * Concurrent JS (slides)
      * Multiple different concurrency modules (weblike and threadlike; or actor and shared memory) - push to improve both models
      * already have basics, but improve ergonomics and allow higher-level constructs
* Bundling (slides)
   * DE: Would be nice to load ES modules natively and efficiently.  Why not module blocks? no way to import each other
   * SH: Why is `module "x"` a totally different proposal from `x = module {`?
   * SH: immediate evaluation?
   * DE: Could be, but not necessarily
   * DE: Inserted directly into the module map of the realm, could maybe insert into network cache, but that would be weird
   * TC: Is there a reason for not doing `module as "file"` (in analogue to `import as`)
   * DE: Performance, privacy+security, build/serve pipelines
      * Loading performance - avoid waterfalls, bundlers get immediate loading, save overhead
      * Bundling CSS+fonts (base64 possible but bad time and sad)
      * IPC - separate network+render processes, more inefficiency
      * ton of module preload commands - blink dominates performance
      * Compression - bundling allows sharing dictionaries
      * Code splitting/chunking - bundles not so good at this
      * Bundles also impede parallel processing (separate resources are easier to see that they can be parallelized)
      * Streaming and caching also impacted negatively
      * Summary: lots of trade-offs between individual resources and bundling
      * Brave has written about bundles being harmful to privacy
      * Origin model - backdoor, need to not represent different origin
      * (Components of bundle ~ URL) which can be fetched individually would be great
      * Tracking, content blocking
   * Design choice: do JS module bundles include top-level … or not? loads into module map - identifiers don't really correspond to URLs because just entered into module map (so also bad for content blocking)
   * New model: resource batch preloading
      * Map from paths to metadata (mime type) and payload
      * Can therefore also include CSS, fonts, etc - need new file since TAR doesn't have field for metadata
      * Individually list requested resources - want to discuss this further from a tooling perspective
      * Can be loaded via a <link> tag or dynamically in JS - but always specify both URL of batch file and the files we're pulling out - allows to not bother fetching if all resources are already cached
      * Browser responsible for subsetting required resources in server request
      * Hopefully memory cache should allow more efficient access w/o IPC overhead
      * Resource batches is a non-credentialed request, required to return same content to all requestors -> meets privacy goals (and all other goals)
   * Metadata could be more than just MIME type - could be used for tools (e.g. framework might thread through a different CSP header for some or all resources).  Authors create batch imports w/ resource lists empty, tooling (bundlers) fills in resources that are actually needed.
   * JM: non-JS resources could provide us with an alternative for embedding non-JS resources into JS bundles - would dig us out of a hole we're definitely in, performance reviews reveal this as a real problem; is module graph nested in format?
   * DE: expressing dependencies is a separate issue - Guy Bedford's depcache proposal would address this.  Also thinking about non-atomic execution idea (execute modules streaming as we discover we're loading them); but HTML can already do this with a bunch of ordered script tags
   * JM: order of resources in file format could motivate placement of resources in memory for more efficient loading/processing (??)
   * DE: file format is free-form, would allow arbitrary ordering
   * SH: assume you're using a header to request a subset?
   * DE: yes, but gets complicated - header has size limits (9k), could use bloom (cuckoo) filter, or maybe a post request to get around limit
   * SH: google uses tons of tiny virtual modules
   * DE: concerns w/ amp and gstatic, etc - could also use query parameters
   * SH: servers could disregard subsetting
   * JM: nice that if header not existing doesn't break the thing then we can do it in an optimizing middleware - having a non-broken (just not as optimal) fallthrough is important
   * DE: unknown subset could require CDN to do lots of extra work (going back to backing server w/ extra logic) to recalculate subset
   * SH: header obviates need to define a new convention/standard on top of existing query parameters, which is awkward; also negative module specifiers (i.e. give me everything but I already have A,B, and C so omit those)
   * JH: similar to gitignore syntax; might need some fundamental changes to caching
   * DE: these would be normal cache issues, maybe stored more deterministically in cache; signed exchange from different origin are stored ephemerally (for security) but because these are same-origin we can retain them longer, don't need segmented part of cache; get in touch with Yoav Weiss
   * JM: does this batch format have no representation of origin?
   * DE: idea is to evolve web bundles into this, rather than have two separate competing proposals; web bundles had lots of complexity to accommodate multiple origins, and we can simplify a lot by not handling it (esp. unauthenticated cross-origin case, which doesn't seem to make as much sense).  google, mozilla, and brave were all positive on this; apple had some concerns about non-JS
   * JM: CSS is a good use case
   * DE: There's already CSS bundling, should just use that system rather than invent a new thing (devil's advocate)?
   * SH: polymer/web components might have wanted non-JS bundling years ago, but now less relevant
   * JM: maybe if we'd had this years ago we might have gone a different direction
   * DE: not sure if everyone's on board w/ direction of CSS modules, but …
   * RGN: http working group pushing to adopt SEARCH as a method - safe idempotent request-payload supporting method; we talked about ugly methods, but this might be the clean way - think of it like GET but with a body/payload
